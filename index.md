## Welcome to GitHub Pages
{% seo %}

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mhsani/smart/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mhsani/smart/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
